# Multi-Year Stock-Analysis

This project uses VBA scripting to analyze stock market data by year (in each sheet of a workbook)

This code allows the user to loop through all the stocks for each year, and creates a summary table which contains:

1. The ticker symbol for each stock
2. The stocks yearly change from opening to closing price
3. The percent change of a particular stock from opening to closing price
4. The total volume of the stock  for that particular year

To use: copy and paste the code into a new module with data and run.
